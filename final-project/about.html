	<h3>Meet Emma Scarborough</h3>
		<p>Photography is a passionate hobby of mine, along with painting, biking, and being a plant-parent. My photography journey began in the midst of all my new hobbies to try out during quarantine in the COVID pandemic of 2020. I was encouraged by my mom to figure out how to use her Nikon DSLR camera, and as I started to mess around with the different settings and buttons I realized “Hey, this is cool!” Once I started taking photos in the outdoors, it became clear that this was a hobby I wanted to save time in my day for.</p>
<p>My favorite genre of photography is nature/wildlife. I usually spend at least an hour each day taking photos with my Nikon DSLR. If it isn’t obvious already, I am a huge animal-lover. In my style of photographing wildlife, I like to get on the level of the animal to get a nice up-close and personal shot. This usually means sitting or laying flat on the ground for animals like rabbits and squirrels. I recently started to work on compositional aspects of my images, which has been my biggest struggle in photography so far.
