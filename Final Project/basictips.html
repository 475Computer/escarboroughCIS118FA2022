		<h3>Tip #1: Exposure</h3>
		<p>The first step in taking a good photograph is to get a properly exposed image. Why is this important? In clear and focused images, you need to be able to see your subject. This is especially important in low-light environments, when your camera might struggle when focusing and you might end up with a really dark photo. Exposure is also a key tool in taking creative images – experimenting with exposure settings can give different moods to a photo. Bright and lighter exposures tend to make photos appear happy or dreamy, while darker exposures can make photos moody or dramatic. Figuring out what exposure you want and how to get it for your image is often the first step in taking better photos.</p>

		<p>There are three camera settings that are very important to getting the right exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Explained briefly, aperture controls how much light your camera can capture and the blurriness of your background. Aperture is represented in your camera as an f-stop. Shutter speed controls how fast the camera captures light and movement. And ISO controls the camera’s sensitivity to light, and will affect how bright or dark your photos appear. All three of these settings can contribute to the exposure in an image, as well as other effects.</p>

		<h3>Tip #2: Composition</h3>
		<p>Composition places elements in your image in a way that draws your eyes around the image. Composition is what can make an image look cluttered, empty, one-sided, full, or balanced. The way you place certain objects in your image and the angle at which you take the image can all play a role in composition.</p>

		<p>Have you ever heard of the rule of thirds? This is a very common practice for getting good compositional photos. According to this rule, an image is broken down into thirds which equals nine "boxes" created by four gridlines. The rule states that you should place your main subject or main areas of focus along the gridlines, either vertically or horizontally. You could place various points of interest at the intersection points between the gridlines. While this is considered a common "rule" in photography, that doesn't mean you must use it all the time, if at all.</p>

		<h3>Tip #3: Color</h3>
		<p>If you have ever edited a photo for fun, was color one of the first things you tweaked in a photo? There are many different ways to edit colors:
			<ul>
				<li>Saturation - or how "colorful" your colors are!</li>
				<li>Hue - changes the actual color based on a color wheel.</li>
				<li>Selective color - Picks one (or more) colors to keep in an image, and makes all other colors unsaturated (or grey/black/white).</li>
				<li>Lightness/Darkness - Affects the lightness and darkness of colors in an image.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>These are some of the basic slider tools you may see on a common photo editing software, maybe even the most basic one on your phone or computer. Editing colors can be a fun way to put some personality into your images, or just experiment and find styles that you like. You can remove all color and create a black and white image, or use selective color to really make a subject's eye color pop! Overall, though, it depends on how you want your images to look.</p>

	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Common Photography-related Terms</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>ISO</td>
				<td>Setting that controls the camera's sensitivity to light. So, it has an effect on image brightness/darkness.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Aperture</td>
				<td>The size of your lens opening, controlling how much light your camera captures. Think of it as the pupil of your eye – your pupil gets smaller and larger depending on the amount of light around you. A camera’s aperture is like the pupil of your eye, opening wider (bigger) to let more light in for dark environments, and getting smaller to let less light in for bright situations.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>F-stop</td>
				<td>This is how photographers refer to specific aperture sizes – as F-stops. You might see them written as values such as f/1.8 or f/16. Generally, larger numbers like f/22 and f/18 refer to small apertures. Smaller numbers, such as f/2 and f/1.8, mean larger apertures.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Exposure</td>
				<td>The lightness or darkness of an image.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Focus</td>
				<td>Similar to how our vision works, an object that is in focus on a camera will appear sharp, while objects and backgrounds not in focus will be blurry.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Noise</td>
				<td>Noise is what we call the “grainy” parts of an image. It can look like the image has little specks all over it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>White Balance</td>
				<td>White balance is how your camera adjusts colors to different light sources so that the color “white” looks white.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Composition</td>
				<td>How the elements of a photo are arranged.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Shutter speed</td>
				<td>The time it takes for your camera's sensor to capture an image.</td>
