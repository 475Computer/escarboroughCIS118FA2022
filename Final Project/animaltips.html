	<h2>How to Photograph Animals</h2>
		<p>I have been around animals for most of my life, and as a kid I was delighted to take photos of my pets. By the time I was a teenager, I had hundreds of photos of my pets on my smartphone. Now, I take photos of my pets and the wildlife in my backyard with my Nikon DSLR.
</p>
		<p>Taking photos of animals can be tough – especially when the animal is uncooperative or running away before you can even lift your camera. It’s easy to get frustrated in these situations, but here are some animal-photography tips based on my experiences that might help you!<p>
		<p>I have split this up into two sections, wildlife and pets, but most tips are relevant for animals in general.</p>
<h2>For Wildlife</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Tip #1 – Be prepared</dt>
		<dd>When taking photos of wildlife, you are probably going to be outdoors. Being prepared to sit in one spot or stand outside for a long time means wearing weather-appropriate clothing, making sure any camera gear you have is safe, dry, and protected from extreme temperatures. This includes your smartphone!</dd>
		<dd>Whenever you are photographing wildlife, especially when travelling, you should know your subjects and surroundings. Know your subjects to understand what you are looking for and how to get photos of them, such as their most active time of day. Know your surroundings to make sure you don’t get lost or aren’t trespassing, or in case of an emergency.</dd>

	<dt>Tip #2 – Still and Silent!</dt>
		<dd>Oftentimes, when you are looking for wildlife to photograph, they will spot you first. Animals need to be alert to survive in their wild environment, and they may see you as a threat. It’s no surprise then, that if you are talking and moving around, your subjects will not appear to you or they will run away. This will also depend, however, on their familiarity with you and the type of animal you are looking to get a photo of.</dd>

	<dt>Tip #3 – Patience… Patience</dt>
		<dd>For me, taking photos of animals requires a lot of patience. It can take some time to understand your subject enough to know how they respond to quick movements and when you will ever see them. There is a degree of unpredictability with wildlife photography, and a lot of good wildlife moments happen on the chance of luck. But, I have found that sometimes even just a few more minutes of waiting can result in something unexpected and worthwhile.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>For Pets</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Tip #4 – What do they like?</dt>
		<dd>Sometimes our pets can be quite uncooperative when it comes to getting a photo. Won’t sit still? Afraid of a camera? Animals can have a variety of responses to something foreign like a camera, so to get a response that you want you need to know what they like. Scared of a camera? Distract them with their favorite toy or treat and take the camera farther away to give them comfortable space. Too energetic? Give them some time to burn out their energy or, act calm and relaxed to demonstrate the behavior you want to see in your pet. Most of this is related to dog behavior, but knowing how your pet acts and incorporating things that they are comfortable with into the photos can help everyone.</dd>
		<dd>I have lived with more cats than dogs, so I have spent more time taking cat photos. I can say that taking photos of cats can be challenging in a different way than taking dog photos, such as how cats like to hide and often sit at inconvenient angles and heights. Cats don’t like to be forced to do… anything, so let them do their thing!</dd>

	<dt>Tip #5 – Have fun!</dt>
		<dd>Sometimes we can get too caught up in the moment of getting that perfect photo of our pets to show off to others. But don’t let perfection take hold of this time you spend with your pet! While setting up staged poses or backdrops for pet photos can look cute, it’s also nice to see photos of your pet just being who they are.</dd>
