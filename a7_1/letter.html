Hello, Muddah! Hello, Faddah! Hello, Mother! Hello, Father!

Here I am at Camp Granada. Camp is very entertaining and they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.

I went hiking with Joe Spivy. He developed poison ivy. You remember Leonard Skinner.
He got towmane Ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.

All the counselors hate the waiters, and the lake has alligators, and the head coach wants no sissies, so he reads to us from something called ulissies Ulysses.

Now I don't want this should scare ya you, but my bunkmate has malaria. You remember Jeffrey Hardy. They're about to organize a searching party.

Take me home, oh Mother, Father! Take me home! I hate Granada! Don't leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear.

Take me home! I promise I will not make noise, or mess the house with other boys.
Oh, please don't make me stay! I've been here one whole day!

Dearest Father, darling Mother, how's my preshus precious little bruddah brother? Let me come home if you miss me. I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me.

Wait a minute! It's stopped hailing. Guys are swimming. Guys are sailing. Playing baseball! Gee, that's bettah better.

Mother, Father, kindly disregard this letter!

Love,
Allan
